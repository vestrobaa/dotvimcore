###Annoyances

'Grrr'

1. Get a good focus writer
1. Keep on committing as wrong ID from the different machines/projects
    - Check with following: git status [--system --global --local] --list
1. Figure out how to do pan instead of movement. 
    -   Example: <C-j> will keep the cursor where it is, but scroll the page up (instead of the cursor down)
1. Where's my cursor?! 
    - set cursorline
