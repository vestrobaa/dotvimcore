###Annoyances

'Grrr'

1. Get a good focus writer
1. Keep on committing as wrong ID from the different machines/projects
    - Check with following: git status [--system --global --local] --list
1. Figure out how to do pan instead of movement. 
    -   Example: <C-j> will keep the cursor where it is, but scroll the page up (instead of the cursor down)
1. Where's my cursor?! 
    - set cursorline
1. Save As does't change the filename of the active buffer. I keep on overwriting the original.
1. Google drive integration?
1. Don't have a good way to replace OneNote with Vim. Almost there...
1. No markdown right adjustment of tags. For example
        # Header 1
       ## Header 2
      ### Header 3
     #### Header 4

          Some Text

       1. List Item
       2. Anoter List Item
1. No easy SQL formatter, the way I like it
