Grrr

*   File navigation window keeps popping up, can't get rid of it (was vinegar)
*   Too much addins
*   Pymode hinders as much as it helps
*   Auto icloud
*   Where's the V8 feature plugins?
*   Redo font/color on the different platforms
*   Fix the diff window settings
*   Bite the bullet and switch to dbext
*   Vim as script runner?
*   Restart the vim twitter configuration

Roadmap
